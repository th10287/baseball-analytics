    "   * If a team has a **90%+** chance of scoring in a given scenario with **0** outs, but a roughly **50%** chance to score in the same scenario with **1** out, we can begin to explain why a team is struggling to win close games."

However, even they top the *Braves* with both the bases loaded and having runners at 1st and 2nd.
